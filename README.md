## Goal
The main aim of this project is to create a user friendly interface for a chatbot.

## What can this bot do?
1. It tells us a joke.
2. It plays games with us.
3. It tells us the current time.


## Coding
This bot contains single webpage. You can see the layout of this webpage [here](https://github.com/Lakshman511/UI_for_Bot/blob/master/index.html). We styled this webpage using bootstrap and html. [This](https://github.com/Lakshman511/UI_for_Bot/blob/master/CSS/bootstrap.css) is the file where you can see the css from bootstrap.[This](https://github.com/Lakshman511/UI_for_Bot/blob/master/CSS/style.css) is  where we have written css to the main page. Taking input from user and performing the tasks related to that input are implemented using java script. [This](https://github.com/Lakshman511/UI_for_Bot/blob/master/JS/functions.js) is the java script file where you can see the all the java script functions we have used.

## Working of bot
[This](https://webpage-1.18pa1a0511arla.repl.co) is the url of our bot. When you open this page, there will be an input bar where user can enter their message. At the top right there will be a button that allows the user to change the theme.There will be a list of tasks that the bot can perform. There will be a send button adjacent to input bar that will help user to send message to bot. When user sends 1 to bot it will get a joke randomly from [this]( https://rapidapi.com/LemmoTresto/api/joke3/endpoints) API. When user enters 2 then input bar and send button will disappear and in that place 3 buttons will be appeared. User should click the button to select a game. There will be an exit button to stop playing games. If user selects RPS game then the images of Rock,Paper and Scissor will be displayed and user should select the image of his/her choice.If user clicks exit while playing a game then main menu containing game buttons will be displayed. If user clicks exit button  in this main menu then these button will be disappeared and input bar will appear. If user enters 3 it will give the current time. if user enters 4 it will stop interaction with user.
This is how our interface looks like:
